Microchip MCW1001A
******************

MCW1001A is a companion chip to the MRF24WB0 802.11 module. It provides simple socket based method of sending and receiving data from the MRF24WB0 802.11 module.

The MCW1001A has an on-board TCP/IP stack and 802.11 connection manager to simplify the connection between a wireless network and the TCP/IP stack management.

After the initial configuration is set, the MCW1001A can access the MRF24WB0 802.11 module to connect to a network and send/receive serial data over a simple UART interface from the Host controller; more information at `Microchip dedicated page <http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCW1001A>`_
