MCW1001A is a companion chip to the MRF24WB0 802.11 module. It provides simple socket based method of sending and receiving data from
the MRF24WB0 802.11 module. The MCW1001A has an on-board TCP/IP stack and 802.11 connection manager to simplify the connection 
between a wireless network and the TCP/IP stack management. After the initial configuration is set, the MCW1001A can access the 
MRF24WB0 802.11 module to connect to a network and send/receive serial data over a simple UART interface from the Host controller.

This Zerynth module currently supports multiple concurrent udp and tcp sockets both in client and server mode. 
No select support is provided.
For WIFI security, only WPA2 is currently supported.

Usage example: ::

    import streams
    from wireless import wifi
    from microchip.mcw1001a import mcw1001a
    
    streams.serial()

    # connect to a wifi network
    try:
        mcw1001a.init(SERIAL1,D16) # specify which serial port will be used and which RST pin

        print("Establishing Link...")
        wifi.link("Network SSID",wifi.WIFI_WPA2,"Password")
        print("Ok!")        
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
